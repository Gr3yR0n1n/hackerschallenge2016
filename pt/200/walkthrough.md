1: Hint: It's home-grown.  
2: Hint: His name translated to English might sound like 'Black Corner'  
3: Hint: Alison Uttley wrote a book about it.  
3: Hint: The book is called, "A Traveller in Time"  
3: Hint: Another book that has a version of the story is "Mary Stuart"  
4: Hint: Like Kahn, he's been Kumberbatched. Unlike Kahn, he's not fictional.  
10: Q occurs pretty rarely (50 times in 400 pages) and Q is always followed by U, and it's the only constant in English.  

U;You've been given 400 pages of some document that's been encoded by some letter-substitution cipher. All you know is it's an English document. You've now done some basic analysis and have found that the letter "G" appears 50 times in the 400 pages. You've also noticed that in all 50 instances of "G", the letter "W" always follows. What does "W" probably represent?  

LorenzCipher;Ok, there was another machine used at Bletchley Park, other than the bombe, to help the Allies win WWII. This one is called Collossus, and it was used to crack what cipher, which was used by high command (not the military)?  

XOR;Certainly when one sees a menu stating "Lunch special: sandwich and soup or salad" (parsed as "sandwich and (soup or salad)" according to common usage in the restaurant trade), one would not expect to be permitted to order both soup and salad. Nor would one expect to order neither soup nor salad, because that belies the nature of the "special", that ordering the two items together is cheaper than ordering them a la carte. Similarly, a lunch special consisting of one meat, French fries or mashed potatoes and vegetable would consist of three items, only one of which would be a form of potato. If one wanted to have meat and both kinds of potatoes, one would ask if it were possible to substitute a second order of potatoes for the vegetable. And, one would not expect to be permitted to have both types of potato and vegetable, because the result would be a vegetable plate rather than a meat plate. What three-letter function does this remind you of?   

Steganography;If I give you a message of some kind, let's say it's a painting, and I was able to alter the quality of the paint so that some of the paint reflected light in a polarized state, and while it appeared to be a lovely painting of Mount Timpanogos to some, but to others, such as yourself, they are able to identify the polarized light and find the hidden message, "LetsGoGetSomeFiveGuys", what would you call this means of communication? And wouldn't this be a huge waste of time and light-altering technology when a text message would have sufficed? I think so. You don't need to answer the second question.

Bombe/BletchleyPark;Back to Alan Turing, what was the name of the device he helped produce that broke the Engima, and where were/are the huts where they employed the machines? [Answer: name/location]  

IntegerFactorizationAndDiscreteLogarithms;Asymmetric encryption algorithms depend on mathematical problems that are thought to be difficult to solve, such as ?????????????????????????????????????????. However, there is no proof that these problems are hard, and a mathematical breakthrough could make existing systems vulnerable to attack.  

AlanTuring;Regarded as many to be the father of modern computing, and the creator of a test for true Artificial Intelligence in computers.  

1587/Babington/Mary/Elizabeth;Oh, the perils of weak cryptography! Death! Treason! The crown and church fought over! It happened a long time ago. Answer thusly: Year of death (xxxx)/Name of plot (The xxxx Plot)/Who died (first name)/Who lived (first name)  

ArnoldSchwarzenegger;What governor used steganography to curse at his opponents in an email response to a blocked bill? (don't share his message in mixed company)  

UtahDigitalSignaturesAct;What was repealed in 2006, enacted in 1995, and provided a legal framework for the use of cryptography for authentication and integrity purposes?
