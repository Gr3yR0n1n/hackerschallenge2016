Use a UserAgent string of SAINTCON

This challenge was familiar to those that participated in the Precon Challenges. If you participated in the Precon challenges then you immediately changed the UserAgent to the GoogleBot agent, which you noticed changed the text. As with most challenges, it makes sense to try variations on "saintcon" as the "password".

There are several plugins/extensions for browsers that allow you to create custom UserAgents. Another option would be to use curl with a customer UserAgent, or yet another, use something like burp suite to intercept headers en-route and change them.
